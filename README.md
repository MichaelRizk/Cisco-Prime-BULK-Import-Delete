# Cisco-Prime-BULK-Import-Delete
Python based Script to BULK Import/Delete devices using Cisco Prime API


What the Script do:

Instead of wasting time adding/deleting Devices manually to Prime or filling excel sheet to BULK import or invoke discovery in Prime to discovera small group of devices in a wide spread network … just use this script and all the repetitive work is automated for you
all you have to know is the Prime API (user/pwd) which is created in Prime and the Network devices IPs .. yes that’s it !
